# Phase 1
## In Phase 1 of the bootcamp, I learnt about Command Line Inputs, I've worked on a few projects to get hands on experience of CLI. I learnt about algorithms, printing patterns, OOPS concept, & Data structures. 

## Below are the CLI apps which I worked on:

1. Base 64 Converter
2. Matrix functions
3. Number System Converter

## Pattern Printing folder has all the pattern printing exersizes that I've worked on

## DSA folder is a progressive folder, where I submit my daily programming practice sessions to resolve various programming challenges.
