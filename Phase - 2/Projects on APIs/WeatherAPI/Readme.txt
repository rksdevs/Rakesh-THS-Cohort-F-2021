This is a simple JS project using a free weather API from openweathermap.org. Below are the features of this app:

1. In this project I've used File System module of Node to read, write and append data from weather API into a file.
2. This project shows how to handle API calls using Axios NPM
3. This project also shows how to handle asynchronos functions in JS using promises
