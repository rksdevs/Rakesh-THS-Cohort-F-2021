This is my first project to handle data from API. In this project I've used a free battery api. Below are the features of this project:

1. You can see the current battery percent of your laptop (even smart phones)
2. You can see the remain time the battery would last (if the device is not charging)
3. You can see the time it will take to charge to 100% (if it is connected to a charger)
