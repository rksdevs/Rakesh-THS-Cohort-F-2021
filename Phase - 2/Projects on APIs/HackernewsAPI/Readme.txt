This is a simple JS Project, where I've used Hackernews' free API to fetch the top 20 stories. And write them into new files & the name of the files will be the id of the top stories. Features:

1. This project uses axios to fetch data from Hackernews API
2. This project also showcases how to handle the asynchronous JS functions, using Async - Await
3. This project also uses the inbuilt File System node module to create and  write data into files
