This is another react app where I've designed a basic Todo list or a task tracker:

Features:
    1. This is a react project which uses a simple database created using json-server NPM 
    2. The tasks can be created, deleted and alarm can be set for reminders
    3. As it uses a database the data will always be available unlike a simple frontend app
    4. An about page, which is handled by react router 

React Hooks & Components:
    1. This app is based on functional Components
    2. React hooks - useState & useEffect hooks were used to define & manage state  
    3. Components - This simple app has various simple components - starting from Header, Buttons, Task, Task Details, to Footer.

Node Modules Used:
    1. Json-server
    2. React-icons
    3. React Router Dom
